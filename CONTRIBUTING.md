# Contributing to the OpenNote Format
Thank you for your interest in ONF. This document explains how to contribute effectively at this stage of the project.

---
## What this project is
ONF is an open specification for a file format for handwritten digital notes. This repository contains the specification document only, not an application or a library. The goal is a vendor-neutral standard that any developer can implement, similar to ODF for word processing.

---
## Current status
The specification is at **v0.1.4**. This means:
- The core design is in place but not yet frozen
- Breaking changes are still possible
- No stability guarantees apply to any part of the format
- External feedback is the most valuable thing this project needs right now

---
## What contributions are welcome
### Specification feedback
If you read the specification and find any of the following, please open a GitHub Issue:
- A requirement that is **impossible to implement** as written
- A requirement that is **ambiguous:** two reasonable developers would interpret it differently
- A **missing definition:** something the spec uses but never explains
- A **contradiction** between two sections
- A **real-world use case** that the format cannot express
- A **mathematical or logical error** in any example or algorithm

### Implementation reports
If you have tried to implement an ONF reader or writer and hit a problem, please open an issue describing:
- Which section or requirement you were implementing
- What the spec says
- What problem you encountered
- What change to the spec would fix it

Implementation reports are extremely valuable. A problem found during implementation is a spec defect, not an implementer error.

### Typos and editorial issues
Small fixes to grammar, spelling, or formatting are welcome as GitHub Issues. Please do not open pull requests for editorial changes at this stage.

## How to open a good issue
A useful issue has three parts:
**1. Location:** which section of the specification the issue is in. Use the section number, for example "Section 7.5.1" or "Appendix A, Example 3."
**2. Problem:** what is wrong or unclear. Quote the relevant text directly.
**3. Suggestion:** if you have one, what you think the fix should be. This is optional but helpful.

Example of a good issue title:
> Section 7.4.4 — line eraser behaviour on front layer is undefined

Example of a less useful issue title:
> The eraser section is confusing

---
## What is not welcome yet
The following are not appropriate contributions at this stage:
**Pull requests to the specification text:** The spec is not yet stable enough to accept text changes from outside. All changes to the specification are made by the project author based on feedback received in issues. This will change when the spec reaches v1.0.0.
**New feature proposals:** The scope of v1.0.0 is defined. Feature requests for things outside that scope (collaboration, encryption, audio, video) are noted but will not be acted on until after v1.0.0 is published. You are welcome to open an issue to record the request for future consideration.
**API or library contributions:** This repository contains only the specification. A reference implementation and API library are planned for after v1.0.0. Code contributions are not accepted here.

---
## Code of conduct
This project is a technical specification developed in the open. All feedback and discussion MUST be respectful and focused on the technical content. Criticism of the specification is welcome and encouraged. Personal criticism of contributors is not. Issues that violate this will be closed.

---
## Questions
If you are unsure whether something is worth raising as an issue, open the issue. A question that turns out to have a simple answer is still useful, if you had the question, someone else will too.
